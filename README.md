# AI-GREEN-SKILL-INTERNSHIP-PROJECT
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. As part of the AI Green Skill Internship, the aim is to utilize data science and machine learning tools to analyze air quality data, predict AQI, and provide insights for better environmental decision-making.

# Objectives
- Analyze air quality data to identify key pollutants and trends.
- Build and train machine learning models to predict AQI based on pollutant levels and environmental factors.
- Validate and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Develop an easy-to-use interface for real-time AQI predictions.
# Features
 # Data Analysis:
  - Statistical summary and visualization of air quality data.
   - Identification of trends and correlations between pollutants and AQI.
# Machine Learning:
- Build regression models to predict AQI values.
- Support for multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression.
# Visualization:
- Visualize pollutant contributions to AQI using interactive plots.
- Provide historical AQI trends and model insights.
  # Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Tools:
    - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
     - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
    - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost


# Dataset

The project uses historical air quality data containing pollutant levels such as:

- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO2
- SO2
- CO
- Ozone (O3)
Data is sourced from government or public databases like OpenAQ or Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Ensure the dataset includes timestamps and geographical information.
# Learning Outcomes
- Gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Learn to implement regression algorithms for real-world applications.
- Develop skills in creating web applications for ML-based solutions.
- Understand environmental factors affecting AQI and its prediction.
